# Automation_Project

I used Selenium:
Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web application tests. It's used to test web applications across multiple browsers. Selenium is primarily built in Java and supports several browsers and programming languages.Selenium supports data-driven testing, where test data is separated from test logic, making it easier to run the same tests with different datasets.
Selenium is widely used in the software testing community for various purposes, including:
Functional Testing: 
Regression Testing:
Performance Testing:
Browser Compatibility Testing:
Data-Driven Testing:
